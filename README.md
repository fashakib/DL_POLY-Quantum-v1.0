DL_POLY Quantum v1.0 is a general purpose open-source software package developed by Mohammad R. Momeni and Farnaz A. Shakib for molecular simulations in condensed phases.

DL_POLY Quantum v1.0 is a modified version of DL_POLY Classic v1.10 originally developed in the Daresbury Laboratory.

A manual will be provided here in the near future. See the README file for instructions on how to compile the code. Test jobs are provided in the data subdirectory.
